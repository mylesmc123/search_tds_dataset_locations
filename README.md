# Background
Script to search out a TDS catalog.xml for reference catalogs, and for each catalog file found, search for the dataset locations being used. The intent is to identify all input sources of data and their respective host server locations.

Next step will be to develop a script that uses a server list to deploy the search script across many TDS servers to search them all at once.
